 - Artax is a natural evolution of blockchain technology.
   Bitcoin pioneered the creation of crypto-currency and even now, 6
   years later, most blockchain systems either rely on Bitcoin itself or
   incorporate relatively minor changes in order to improve it in a
   handful of limited ways.
   
  - Artax is different. Artax is a platform that envelopes ECP
   (Encryption Cache Technology) which allows you to create your own
   security and storage applications directly on its blockchain. It is
   simple and easy. Whether you are an enthousiast, a professional with
   a company or a developer: Artax vastly simplifies using blockchain
   technology.
   
 -  Artax is a simple, sustainable and versatile platform that directly
   benefits everyone.(edited) Artax is built with your freedom in mind.
   Artax does not force you to use your property or funds as we would
   like it, it gives you the freedom to be in complete control over what
   is yours.
   
 -  Artax Assets, Currencies and Artax itself can be traded freely, and
 - access to the Artax system cannot be denied: Artax is being run on
   servers all around the globe.
   
-   If you want to join the Artax movement, to be a pioneer of the new
   decentralised future, you only need to download the Artax software,
   install it and go!
   
   - PROFESSIONALS Artax allows you to tap into the world of decentralised
   and digital trading by eliminating the need for expensive middle men
   and services.
   
-   With Artax, you can create your own tokens and currencies, and use
   them in so many ways: to trade directly on the blockchain via the
   simple and secure Asset Exchange system, to take your tokens out into
   the wider financial world, or to use them to raise funds for
   something that may have nothing to do with finance.
   
  -  You can create your own digital assets and integrate them into your
   existing systems, crowdfund your projects and use Artax’s in-built
   authentication tools. The sky truly is the limit, the range of
   applications for Artax within existing businesses or now projects is
   practically unlimited
   
 -  Far more than just a financial tool, Artax offers opportunities for
   anyone who is doing business in the 21st century.
